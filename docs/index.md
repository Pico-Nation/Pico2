PICOIO is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. PICOIO comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in PICOIO are the following:

* [Nodpico](01_nodpico/index.md) (node + pico = nodpico)  - Core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [Clpico](02_clpico/index.md) (cli + pico = clpico) - Command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `nodpico`) and manage wallets (via `kpicod`).
* [Kpicod](03_kpicod/index.md) (key + pico = kpicod) - Component that manages PICOIO keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
