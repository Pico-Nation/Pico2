content_title: PICOIO Software Installation
---

There are various ways to install and use the PICOIO software:

* [Install PICOIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build PICOIO from Source](01_build-from-source/index.md)

[[info]]
| If you are new to PICOIO, it is recommended that you install the [PICOIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md), then proceed to the [Getting Started](https://developers.pico.io/picoio-home/docs/) section of the [PICOIO Developer Portal](https://developers.pico.io/). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build PICOIO from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.

1. Amazon Linux 2
