content_title: Build PICOIO from Source
---

[[info | Building PICOIO is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to PICOIO, it is recommended that you install the [PICOIO Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

PICOIO can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build PICOIO using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | PICOIO Installation Recommended]]
| After building PICOIO successfully, it is highly recommended to install the PICOIO binaries from their default build directory. This copies the PICOIO binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/picoio/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the PICOIO release version.
