[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the PICOIO software and dependencies.

To build PICOIO from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download PICOIO Source](01_download-picoio-source.md)
2. [Build PICOIO Binaries](02_build-picoio-binaries.md)
3. [Install PICOIO Binaries](03_install-picoio-binaries.md)
4. [Test PICOIO Binaries](04_test-picoio-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall PICOIO](05_uninstall-picoio.md)

[[info | Building PICOIO is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to PICOIO, it is recommended that you install the [PICOIO Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
