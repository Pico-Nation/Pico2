content_title: Uninstall PICOIO
---

If you have previously built PICOIO from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `picoio_uninstall.sh` script within the `pico/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/picoio/pico
./scripts/picoio_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall PICOIO dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt PICOIO binaries or building PICOIO for the first time.
